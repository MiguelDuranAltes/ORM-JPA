# ORM-JPA

The main objective of this work is to implement the persistence layer of a Java application (corresponding to the domain assigned in the subject to each practice group, in my case it was a dairy products company), using a persistence provider (Hibernate) that implements the JPA standard.

The work will consist of several parts:
1. Class diagram design.
2. Implementation to Business layer
   b. Persistence layer
   c. Test cases
3. Drafting of the report
