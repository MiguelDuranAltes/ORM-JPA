# ORM-JPA - Data Integration Project

This project was created for the *Data Integration* course. The objective was to implement the persistence layer of a Java application for a dairy products company, using Hibernate as a persistence provider that implements the JPA standard.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into several parts, each focusing on different aspects of the application:

1. **Class Diagram Design**: 
   - The class diagram represents the structure and relationships of the entities in the system, such as `Product`, `Customer`, `Order`, etc., to model the dairy products business.
   
2. **Business Layer Implementation**:
   - The business layer focuses on the logic related to the business processes and operations, such as managing product inventory, customer orders, and other relevant processes for the dairy business.
   
3. **Persistence Layer Implementation**:
   - The persistence layer is implemented using Hibernate, following the JPA standard to handle database operations (CRUD operations) for the business entities, ensuring proper data storage and retrieval.
   
4. **Test Cases**:
   - Test cases are created to ensure the functionality of the application. These tests ensure that all components, especially the persistence layer, are working as expected, and they are integral to verifying the correctness of the implementation.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The core programming language for the application.
- **Hibernate**: The persistence provider used to implement the JPA standard for object-relational mapping (ORM).
- **JPA (Java Persistence API)**: A standard specification for accessing, persisting, and managing data between Java objects and relational databases.
- **JUnit**: Used for writing and running test cases for the project.
